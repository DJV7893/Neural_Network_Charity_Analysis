# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
---
## Overview:
---

For our analysis we have been tasked by Alphabet Soup's business team to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. In order to complete our analysis we will use a CSV file containing metadata from more than 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years in order to create a deep-learning neural network with the TensorFlow platform in Python. The steps required to produce our final model involve: preprocessing the data for the neural network model, compiling, training and evaluating the model and finally optimizing the model.
